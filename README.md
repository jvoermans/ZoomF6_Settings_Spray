# ZoomF6_Settings_Spray
Default recording settings for spray

Includes a ZIP-file with ZoomF6_Settings.
Note that computers may alter the properties of the file, ZoomF6 may not be able to read the settings file.
This worked for me:

(1) Put an SD-card in the ZoomF6<br>
(2) Turn it on, follow prompts when needed (language, time, ...)<br>
(3) Turn off ZoomF6<br>
(4) Insert in computer, open "F6_Settings" folder <br>
(5) Copy the ZIP-file in this folder and unpack<br>
(6) Copy the settings file, e.g. the "*.ZSF" file directly in the "F6_Settings" folder of the SD-card<br>
(7) Insert back in the ZoomF6 and turn on<br>
(8) MENU> > SETTINGS > SD CARD > BACKUP SETTINGS > LOAD/DELETE. Then select the correct settings backup file<br>
(9) Execute<br>
